# To-do
* None
# Notes
* forwardRef, pass a ref to a child component simple as that
* useImperativeHandle, takes a ref forwarded from a parent, and defines a collection of functions that it can access
* To handle an axios error, do so using a try ... catch block with in async function, to pass the error value to other functions that called this one, in the catch block either do throw **var_name** or return Promise.reject(**var_name**)
* useRef is an object with a single property **current**, and if that changes it does not cause a re-render like useState does.
